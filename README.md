# Yeshivat-Torat-Shraga
Official repository for the Torat Shraga app

## What is this repository?
This is where all code written for the Torat Shraga iOS app is kept.

## What does the app do?
The app is targeted towards Torat Shraga alumi, as a way for students to keep in touch with the Yeshiva.
Pictures, news, and recorded _shiurim_ are all available here, allowing students to stay in the loop.

## Why did you create this app?
One of the rebbeim in Yeshiva came up with this idea and asked us if we can make it a reality.
We told him that we'd love an opportunity to give back to the Yeshiva and that we're glad to help.

## I was looking through your code and I found something that I really liked. Can I copy it?
That's a good question. We have not yet decided on what licence to use for this repository,
but if you shoot us an email, I'm sure we can work it out.

## OMG, I am so blown away by this repository that I am filled with an irresistible urge to hire you on the spot. How can I contact you?
We are reachable through email.
